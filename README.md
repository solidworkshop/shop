# Admin Console notes (v1.2.0)

- **Automation controls**: set intervals; choose whether to send Pixel/CAPI; set what % of Purchases include `profit_margin` and `pltv`.
- **Manual Send (raw JSON)**: paste a payload; Validate; Send. Manual sends go to both channels regardless of automation switches.
- **Chaos toggles**: simulate drops, omissions, malformed payloads.
- **Counters**: Margin Events/PLTV Events count how many events carry those fields (both channels combined).
- **Health & Pixel Check**: run install check and jump to the Request Inspector quickly.
